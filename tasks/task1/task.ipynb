    "Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944), a pioneering photographer extensively traveled the Russian Empire from 1909 to 1915, capturing thousands of images. Employing an early color technology, he recorded three images of each scene onto glass plates using red, green, and blue filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to take Gorskii glass plate RGB color channels and produce a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible (ignore the artifacts at the image boundaries). To do this, you will need to read the image file, extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image. You will need to implement this in Python.\n",

    "**Note** that the channel order for all files from top to bottom is BGR, not RGB!"
